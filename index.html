				<p style="padding-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 0px;text-indent:50px;margin:0% 20% 0% 20%">Hello I'm Niklas, a Mechanical Engineer working at Quantum Space as thermal lead. Previously I worked at NASA Ames Research Center. I was part of the Advanced Development Group (ADP), working on a spacecraft called PACE-2. In addition to being the thermal lead for the mission, I heavily supported the mechanical design and testing of the satellite. </p>
				<p style="padding-top: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;text-indent:50px;margin:0% 20% 0% 20%"> Before I started at NASA, I got my Masters with a focus in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Georgia. While completing my Master's at the University, I was heavily involved with the <a href="http://www.smallsat.uga.edu/" target="_blank">UGA Small Satellite Research Laboratory (SSRL)</a>. At the time of joining the team, the SSRL was building UGA's first two satellites (SPOC & MOCI) to launch into LEO - the first one (SPOC) launched on October 3rd, 2020. As "CAD Specialist" on the Mechanical Team in the SSRL, I have worked on both satellites, designed ground support equipment and developed instruments for our vacuum chamber. Since my first semester, I have also been part of the UGA Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). The SAE team took part in the Lincoln Formula SAE Competion in 2019.</p>

So far I have been part of five satellite missions and one rover mission on base. Summer 2020 I even received a shoutout from NASA Technology for National Intern Day on <a href="https://twitter.com/nasa_technology/status/1288915268849283074?s=21" target="_blank"> Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/108559879193246/posts/3151744541541416/?d=n" target="_blank"> Facebook</a>.

				For my Master's Thesis I was conducting research with the help of the UGA Dynamic Devices and Solutions Lab. If certain conditions are met, mechanical structures can exhibit the remarkable ability to self-synchronize. My thesis implements numerical models of such structures with the goal of understanding conditions that conduce synchronization.</p>

			<p style="text-align: left;text-indent:50px;margin:0% 20% 0% 20%">I have noticed that some people at the gym struggle to hold onto the lat-pull bars which is why I challenged myself to make a more ergonomic bar. I've prototyped numerous interations of the handle to optimize the hand shape. I then started modeling the bar X-section to maximize the inertia for size and style, hand calcs and FEA confirmed comfortable margins based on carbon fiber properties and loading.</p> 
			<p style="text-align: left;text-indent:50px;margin:0% 20% 0% 20%"> I 3D printed the bar and spray painted on a surface coat which I then sanded and polished to a glozzy finish (bottom left). Next I began making the mold from a high-temp gel coat, supported by fiberglass and high temp resin. It's a 10 pieces mold due to the complex geometry as seen below. I'm waiting on the pre-preg I need to be back in stock before next steps.</p>

			<p style="text-align: left;text-indent:50px;margin:0% 20% 0% 20%"> Above and below you can see some pictures of the project. I built it up in CAD, internal dims = 1250x400x400mm. I disassembled a used air-fryer (top middle photo) for the heating element, fan, and motor. The oven is well insulated featuring 3 different forms of insulation - aluminum teflon film, 1.5" fiberglass insulation, and 1.5" pink insulation. The areas surrounding the heating element are covered in ceraminc fiber (top right photo) to reduce risk of fire. Additional temp sensor built into circuit for safety shutdown. PID and thermocouple for control/feedback (top left photo).</p>

			<p style="text-align: left;text-indent:50px;margin:0% 20% 0% 20%">On the weekends I like to play street hockey in San Francisco; however, the stick I purchased is made for ice hockey meaning it wears down quickly when playing on concrete. To fix this issue I decided to make a forged carbon fiber hockey stick protector. I started off by 3D printing the design using references images, to check the fit. Since forged carbon fiber requires a lot of compression, I had to design for the right amount of cavity space that would allow gradual and high stress compression of the composite. </p> 
			<p style="text-align: left;text-indent:50px;margin:0% 20% 0% 20%"> I 3D printed the mold, applied a release agent, and filled the inside with carbon strips and resin. It's important to use the right carbon to resin ratio as otherwise voids can be found in the material. I then put the mold halves and center pieces together and clamped/fastened it shut. Afterwards, I proceeded to sand and apply a final clear coat to the surface. It has held up amaizingly so far! </p>

As a challenge I decided to fully model and render the car. I first setup my reference frames in 3ds Max based on the car's blueprint as seen in the picture on the bottom left. </p> 
			<p style="text-align: left;text-indent:50px;margin:0% 20% 0% 20%"> I then preoceeded with building the mesh, starting with the main panels and working my way to the smaller details. Creating all the small parts, specifically the lights and wheels, took longer than expected but I'm very happy the result. Next, I created the textures, materials, and lights for each component. Lastly I set up the scence as shown in the picture on the bottom right and added the camera views for final render. </p>

				<p style="text-align: left;padding-bottom:0px;text-indent:50px;margin:0% 20% 0% 20%">This project was done for and with the Small Satellite Research Labaoratory. A important step in building a satellite is testing it - making sure the satellite can survive the extreme environmental conditions of space. To do so, we replicated this environment (in our case LEO) in accordance to requirements specified by NASA, Nanoracks, and the University Nanosatellite Project (UNP). This included thermal cycling the satellite in both atmospheric and vacuum environments. The first step in creating this test setup was to model our vacuum chamber. </p>

The challenge was creating enough heat to increase the temperature of the satellite through radiation in a 10e-6 torr environment. The framed picture is the final design.

			<p style="text-align: left;text-indent:50px;margin:0% 20% 0% 20%"> The parts will be 3D-printed and coated with leather or suede. It was modeled and toleranced in such a way that all creases from layering the leather disappear and the final product looks clean/seamless. This also meant that fasterners had to remain hidden to give it a smooth and slick look. </p>
			<p style="text-align: left;text-indent:50px;margin:0% 20% 0% 20%"> The hardware inside has already been tested and consists of an Arduino Nano, Stepper Motor, H-Bridge, two 9V batteries, and a Pin Switch. Right now the motor switches from CW to CCW every hour, depending on the watch movement I will vary the direction of rotation. Note that fasteners and internal hardware are not included in the exploded view above. </p>
