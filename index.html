				<p2 style="padding-bottom: 40px">I am currently a Master's Student at the University of Georgia. At the University, I am heavily involved with the <a href="http://www.smallsat.uga.edu/" target="_blank">UGA Small Satellite Research Laboratory (SSRL) </a>which is working on building UGA's first two satellites (SPOC & MOCI) to launch into LEO, the first currently being on the ISS waiting for deployment. As "CAD Specialist" on the Mechanical Team on the SSRL, I have worked on both satellites as well as designed testing equipment for our vacuum chamber. For my Master's Thesis I am working with the UGA Dynamics Devices and Solutions Lab on numerical analysis for oscillatory synchronization. Additionally, I have been part of the UGA Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) since my first semester. The SAE is currently competing in the Lincoln Formula SAE Competition. Over the last four summers I have worked 10 week contracting jobs at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, CA, with the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/small_spacecraft/index.html" target="_blank">Small Spacecraft Technology Program (SSTP)</a>,<a href="https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/groups/intelligent-robotics/" target="_blank"> Intelligent Robotics Group (IRG)</a> and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/engineering/mission-design-center" target="_blank"> Mission Design Center (MDC)</a>. Overall I worked on five satellite missions and one rover mission. </p2>

				<p style="text-align: left">If certain conditions are met, mechanical systems can exhibit the remarkable ability to self-synchronize. This thesis implements low-order models of two such systems. The first models describe the behavior of two coupled pendula attached through a rigid body, a system commonly known as Huygens' clocks. The two pendula are subject to excitation through an external moment applied by an escapement mechanism. There are two types of escapement mechanisms considered: Hamiltonian and Van der Pol escapement. Depending on initial conditions and escapement parameters, the system will fall into one of three post-transient states, which are classified according to the phase difference between the two pendula. These states are: in-phase synchronization, out-of-phase synchronization, or asynchronous motion. One objective of this thesis is to map sets of parameters and initial conditions to one of these three states. The second set of models considered here shows how two oscillators may be synchronized without a physical connection. The system again includes two pendula, but now the rigid body is removed. Information on the state of a primary pendulum is passed to the secondary pendulum in the form of changes to the escapement moment. The results suggest the feasibility of synchronizing remote mechanical oscillators uisng wireless signals.</p>

				<p style="text-align: left;padding-bottom:20px">The project concerns the Small Satellite Research Labaoratory. Part of ensuring that the satellites work correctly in LEO requires testing. As a result the lab was given requirements by NASA, Air Force, and the University Nanosatellite Project (UNP) to test the satellites. Part of which is heating and cooling the satellite in both atmospheric and vacuum environments. It started with modeling the vacuum chamber.</p>

				<p style="text-align:left">It started with coming up with a variety of designs that would both fit the chamber and fulfill the heating requirements, the challenge was creating enough heat to increase the temperature of the satellite through radiation in 10e-6 torr. The framed picture is the final design.

A copper coil surrounding a copper cylinder is extruded to help catch radiated heat. For cooling, liquid nitrogen is pumped through the tubes.

			<ul style="text-align: left;"><li>I am working on stabilizing a drone using with the help of a neural network. I'm experimenting with <a href="https://gym.openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI's Gym </a>environment, more specifically the "Cartpole" problem to teach the neural network to stabilize a pole. Depending on the success I might stick with simply a neural network or might integrate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning" target="_blank">Q-learning algorithm</a>.</li> 
			<li>The plan is to use a Raspberry Pie and Arduino Uno as the main computing units. The Pie for the AI and the Arduino for motor control and stabilization. With the given information from the Arduino the Pie will tell it what to do. I am still uncertain whether the Raspberry Pie has the computing speed required. So far I have set up a gyro and am working on firstly setting up the neural network in the gym environment.</li>

			The project still has a far way to go but I'll continue working on it and see where it goes.</li>
