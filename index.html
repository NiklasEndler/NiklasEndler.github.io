				<div>
					<img class="circle-img" src="nick.png">
				</div>
				<p2>I am a third year Mechanical Engineer at the University of Georgia minoring in Math. At the university, I am heavily involved with the <a href="http://www.smallsat.uga.edu/" target="_blank">UGA Small Satellite Research Laboratory (SSRL) </a>which is working on building UGA's first two satellites (SPOC & MOCI) to launch into LEO, the first one as soon as late 2019. As "CAD Specialist" on the Mechanical Team on the SSRL, I have worked on both satellites as well as designed testing equipment for our vacuum chamber. Additionally, I have been part of the UGA Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) since my first semester. The SAE is currently competing in the Lincoln Formula SAE Competition. Summer 2017 I worked 10 weeks at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, CA, with the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/small_spacecraft/index.html" target="_blank">Small Spacecraft Technology Program (SSTP)</a>,<a href="https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/groups/intelligent-robotics/" target="_blank"> Intelligent Robotics Group (IRG)</a> and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/engineering/mission-design-center" target="_blank"> Mission Design Center (MDC)</a>. This past summer I returned to NASA Ames for another 10 weeks. Overall I worked on four satellite missions and one rover mission. </p2>

				<p1 style="padding-bottom:20px;">The project concerns the Small Satellite Research Labaoratory. Part of ensuring that the satellites work correctly in LEO requires testing. As a result the lab was given requirements by NASA, Air Force, and the University Nanosatellite Project (UNP) to test the satellites. Part of which is heating and cooling the satellite in both atmospheric and vacuum environments. It started with modeling the vacuum chamber.</p1>
				<div>
					<img class="hand_2" src="shroud_1.png" >
					<img class="hand_2" src="shroud_2.jpg" >
				</div>
				<p3>It started with coming up with a variety of designs that would both fit the chamber and fulfill the heating requirements, the challenge was creating enough heat to increase the temperature of the satellite through radiation in 10e-6 torr. The framed picture is the final design.

					<img style="border:5px solid orange" class="hand_2" src="shroud_6.jpg" >
				</div>
				<p3>Below is the final manufactured product. The principles are four heating elements to heat the satellite on the y sides. A copper coil surrounding a copper cylinder is extruded to help catch radiated heat. For cooling, liquid nitrogen is pumped through the tubes. Image on left pictures the shroud with a 3D printed model of satellite.

				<p1>I started and finished the project over the last summer. I saw an extremely realistic facial rig on Twitter when I wanted to create my own. Below is a quick animation from the rig in Blender.

				<p2>I took pictures of my hand in top and side perspectives and then used photoshop to level them out to give the right aspect rations for the two angles.

				<p>I used both <span style="color: #FFAA00"> Blender </span> (right) and Autodesk <span style="color: #00D4FF">3ds Max </span> (left). </p>
				<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #FFAA00">Blender:</span> Created textures, the texture is actually multi-layered meaning it has different layers through which the light penetrates, giving it a more realistic "skin-like" look. I also created the bone structure (vertex assignment), lighting and animation with this software. </p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #00D4FF">3ds Max:</span> Layed out my reference picutes as stated above. Then I created and positioned the mesh with respect to pictures.</p>

			<ul style="text-align: left;"><li>I am working on stabilizing a drone using with the help of a neural network. I'm experimenting with <a href="https://gym.openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI's Gym </a>environment, more specifically the "Cartpole" problem to teach the neural network to stabilize a pole. Depending on the success I might stick with simply a neural network or might integrate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning" target="_blank">Q-learning algorithm</a>.</li> 
			<li>The plan is to use a Raspberry Pie and Arduino Uno as the main computing units. The Pie for the AI and the Arduino for motor control and stabilization. With the given information from the Arduino the Pie will tell it what to do. I am still uncertain whether the Raspberry Pie has the computing speed required. So far I have set up a gyro and am working on firstly setting up the neural network in the gym environment.</li>
			<li>
			The project still has a far way to go but I'll continue working on it and see where it goes.</li>
